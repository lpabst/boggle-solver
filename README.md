# Boggle-Solver

Type in the letters that appear on your boggle board, and this app will search through a dictionary of over 450,000 words to find all of the matches in the boggle board. 

I've organized the dictionary into a trie. Searching the entire Boggle board takes about 7.5 seconds with the current data structure and algorithm.
